# tactile-win

`tactile-win` is a personal learning project written in Rust.

The goal of this project is to:
- learn idiomatic Rust by building a non-trivial application
- explore Windows-specific APIs (WinAPI)
- experiment with window management and desktop automation concepts

The application is inspired by the GNOME extension 'Tactile', but is implemented as a native Windows application.

This project is currently in an early development stage and is primarily intended as a learning exercise.
